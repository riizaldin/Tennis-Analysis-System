tracker_type: botsort  # BoT-SORT tracker

# ReID model for appearance feature extraction
with_reid: True  # Enable ReID for better re-identification

# Tracking parameters
track_high_thresh: 0.5  # High threshold for track initialization (detection confidence)
track_low_thresh: 0.1   # Low threshold for track continuation
new_track_thresh: 0.6   # Threshold for creating new tracks
track_buffer: 30        # Number of frames to keep lost tracks (1 second at 30fps)
match_thresh: 0.8       # Matching threshold for association (higher = stricter)

# Motion model parameters
