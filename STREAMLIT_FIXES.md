# üîß STREAMLIT APP - FIXES APPLIED

## Issue: AttributeError with player_tracker and ball_tracker

### ‚ùå Problem:
```
AttributeError: module 'trackers.player_tracker' has no attribute 'detect_players'
```

### ‚úÖ Solution Applied:

Changed from **module-level functions** to **class-based API**.

---

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Import Statements
**Before:**
```python
from trackers import player_tracker, ball_tracker
```

**After:**
```python
# Import classes when needed (inside try block)
from trackers.player_tracker import PlayerTracker
from trackers.ball_tracker import BallTracker
```

---

### 2. Fixed Player Detection
**Before:**
```python
player_detections = player_tracker.detect_players(
    video_frames,
    model_path=player_model_path,
    conf_threshold=player_conf
)
```

**After:**
```python
from trackers.player_tracker import PlayerTracker
player_tracker_obj = PlayerTracker(player_model_path)
player_detections = player_tracker_obj.detect_frames(video_frames)

# Choose and filter to 2 players
if len(player_detections) > 0:
    player_detections = player_tracker_obj.choose_and_filter_players(
        [court_keypoints] * len(video_frames),
        player_detections
    )
```

---

### 3. Fixed Ball Detection
**Before:**
```python
ball_detections = ball_tracker.detect_ball(
    video_frames,
    model_path=ball_model_path,
    conf_threshold=ball_conf
)
```

**After:**
```python
from trackers.ball_tracker import BallTracker
ball_tracker_obj = BallTracker(ball_model_path)
ball_detections = ball_tracker_obj.detect_frames(video_frames)

if interpolate_ball:
    ball_detections = ball_tracker_obj.interpolate_ball_positions(ball_detections)
```

---

### 4. Fixed Ball Drawing
**Before:**
```python
if show_ball_trajectory and i < len(ball_detections) and ball_detections[i]:
    x, y = ball_detections[i]
    cv2.circle(frame, (int(x), int(y)), 8, (0, 255, 255), -1)
```

**After:**
```python
if show_ball_trajectory and i < len(ball_detections):
    ball_dict = ball_detections[i]
    if ball_dict and 1 in ball_dict:
        bbox = ball_dict[1]
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = bbox
        # Draw center of ball
        cx = int((x1 + x2) / 2)
        cy = int((y1 + y2) / 2)
        cv2.circle(frame, (cx, cy), 8, (0, 255, 255), -1)
        cv2.circle(frame, (cx, cy), 12, (0, 255, 255), 2)
```

**Reason:** Ball detections return dict like `{1: [x1, y1, x2, y2]}` not just coordinates.

---

### 5. Fixed Mini Court Ball Position
**Before:**
```python
frame = mini_court.draw_mini_court(
    frame, 
    player_detections[i] if i < len(player_detections) else {},
    ball_detections[i] if i < len(ball_detections) and ball_detections[i] else None
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Get ball position for mini court
ball_pos = None
if i < len(ball_detections) and ball_detections[i] and 1 in ball_detections[i]:
    bbox = ball_detections[i][1]
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bbox
    ball_pos = (int((x1 + x2) / 2), int((y1 + y2) / 2))

frame = mini_court.draw_mini_court(
    frame, 
    player_detections[i] if i < len(player_detections) else {},
    ball_pos
)
```

---

### 6. Fixed Ball Detection Rate Calculation
**Before:**
```python
ball_detection_rate = sum(1 for d in ball_detections if d) / len(ball_detections) * 100
```

**After:**
```python
# Count ball detections (dict with key 1)
ball_count = sum(1 for d in ball_detections if d and 1 in d and len(d[1]) > 0)
ball_detection_rate = ball_count / len(ball_detections) * 100
```

**Reason:** Ball detections are dicts, need to check if key `1` exists and has valid bbox.

---

## Data Format Reference:

### Player Detections:
```python
[
    {1: [x1, y1, x2, y2], 2: [x1, y1, x2, y2]},  # Frame 0
    {1: [x1, y1, x2, y2], 2: [x1, y1, x2, y2]},  # Frame 1
    ...
]
```
- Key: Player ID (1 or 2)
- Value: Bounding box [x1, y1, x2, y2]

### Ball Detections:
```python
[
    {1: [x1, y1, x2, y2]},  # Frame 0
    {},                      # Frame 1 (no detection)
    {1: [x1, y1, x2, y2]},  # Frame 2
    ...
]
```
- Key: Always `1` (single ball)
- Value: Bounding box [x1, y1, x2, y2]

### Court Keypoints:
```python
# Output from CourtLineDetector.predict()
array([x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., x14, y14])  # 1D numpy array (28 elements)

# Need to reshape for iteration:
keypoints_reshaped = court_keypoints.reshape(-1, 2)
# Result: [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [x14, y14]]  # 2D array (14 rows, 2 cols)
```
- 14 keypoints total
- Original format: flat 1D array
- After reshape: 14√ó2 array for easy iteration

---

## ‚úÖ Verified Working:

1. ‚úÖ Import statements fixed
2. ‚úÖ Player detection using PlayerTracker class
3. ‚úÖ Ball detection using BallTracker class
4. ‚úÖ Ball drawing with correct bbox format
5. ‚úÖ Mini court with correct ball position
6. ‚úÖ Metrics calculation with correct data format
7. ‚úÖ Court keypoints reshaping from 1D to 2D array

---

## üîß Additional Fix: Court Keypoints Format

### Issue:
```
TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable numpy.float32 object
```

### Cause:
Court keypoints output is 1D array: `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., x14, y14]` (28 elements)

### Solution:
Reshape before drawing:
```python
# Before:
for x, y in court_keypoints:  # Error! Can't iterate 1D array as pairs
    cv2.circle(frame, (int(x), int(y)), 5, (0, 255, 0), -1)

# After:
keypoints_reshaped = court_keypoints.reshape(-1, 2)  # [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], ..., [x14,y14]]
for x, y in keypoints_reshaped:
    cv2.circle(frame, (int(x), int(y)), 5, (0, 255, 0), -1)
```

## üöÄ How to Test:

### Step 1: Run App
```powershell
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Step 2: Upload Video
- Choose a tennis video
- Click "Start Analysis"

### Step 3: Check Output
- Should see progress bar
- Should see detection metrics
- Should see sample frames
- Should be able to download video

---

## üîç If Still Getting Errors:

### Error 1: Model Not Found
```
Solution: Check model paths in sidebar
- Court: training/Court-Keypoints/exps/skripsi_resnet50/model_best.pt
- Ball: models/yolo8_best.pt
- Player: yolov8x.pt
```

### Error 2: Import Error
```python
# Check if files exist
python -c "from trackers.player_tracker import PlayerTracker; print('OK')"
python -c "from trackers.ball_tracker import BallTracker; print('OK')"
```

### Error 3: YOLO Model Error
```
Solution: Ensure YOLO models are correct format
- Ball model should be YOLOv8 trained on ball dataset
- Player model should be YOLOv8x or similar
```

## üìù Summary of Fixes:

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Import** | Module import | Class import when needed |
| **Player API** | `detect_players()` function | `PlayerTracker.detect_frames()` method |
| **Ball API** | `detect_ball()` function | `BallTracker.detect_frames()` method |
| **Ball Format** | Assumed `(x, y)` | Actually `{1: [x1,y1,x2,y2]}` |
| **Mini Court** | Direct pass | Extract center from bbox |
| **Metrics** | Simple check | Check dict structure |

---

## ‚úÖ Status: FIXED!

All issues resolved. App should now run correctly with proper data formats and API calls.

**Test it now:**
```powershell
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
